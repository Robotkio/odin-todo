# odin-todo
The goal is to create a light, little ToDo app making use of what I've learned so far, which is quite a lot, and then going further to add an utilize things I've not yet interacted with.

## ToDo (Ironically):

- [ ] Gather requirements
      - [ ] Double-check assignment page
      - [ ] Create vague architectural plan
- [x] Create generic, git project template
      - Look in "Revisiting Webpack"
      - Vaguely match restaurant project folder structure
- [ ] Create visual template (HTML, CSS)
- [ ] Explore date-fns as per assignment
- [ ] Explore localStorage as per assignment
- [ ] Encorporate new libraries into project
- [ ] Build out basic functionality
- [ ] Test and tweak
- [ ] Verify functionality against other examples
- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Submit
